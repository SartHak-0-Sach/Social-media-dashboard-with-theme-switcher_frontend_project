## Overview

### The Challenge

Track your social media performance and engagement with the Social Media Dashboard. Switch between light and dark themes for a personalized experience.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I Learned

This project has really boosted my learning journey because the more you apply your knowledge in development, the better one becomes is what I believe and implementing this project has been nothing short of a challenge in itself.

This project really helped me in revising various concepts as mentioned below and helped me find a lot of my weaknesses to work on.

- Implementing a theme switcher functionality with JavaScript
- Styling elements for both light and dark themes
- Managing user preferences with local storage

JavaScript code snippet that I am proud of

```js
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    let toggleSwitch = document.querySelector(".switch");
    let topBg = document.querySelector('.top-bg');
      let body = document.querySelector('.body');
      let card = document.querySelectorAll('.card');
      let grayText = document.querySelectorAll('.gray-text');
      
    
  
    toggleSwitch.addEventListener("change", () => {
      body.classList.toggle('body-light');
      topBg.classList.toggle('top-bg-light');
          
          card.forEach(card => {
              card.classList.toggle('card-light');
              if(!card.classList.contains('dark')) {
                  card.classList.add('dark');
              } else {
                  card.classList.remove('dark');
              }
          })
  
          grayText.forEach(gText => {
              gText.classList.toggle('gray-text-light')
          })
    });
  });
```

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.
